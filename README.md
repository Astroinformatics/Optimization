## Running Labs
Instructions will be provided for students to run labs on AWS severs during the summer school.  Below are instruction for running them outside of the summer school.

### Running Pluto notebooks on your local computer
Summer School participants will be provided instructions for accessing a Pluto server.  Others may install Julia and Pluto on their local computer with the following steps:
1.  Download and install current version of Julia from [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2.  Run julia
3.  From the Julia REPL (command line), type
```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("Pluto")
```
(Steps 1 & 3 only need to be done once per computer.)

4.  Start Pluto
```julia
julia> using Pluto
julia> Pluto.run()
```
5.  Open the Pluto notebook for your lab
